# **🚀 AgenticFrontier: Multi-Agent Systems Research Hub**

Welcome to **AgenticFrontier**, a repository dedicated to exploring the frontier of **multi-agent systems**, **artificial intelligence**, and **distributed expertise**. Just like Star Trek’s mission to explore the unknown, this repository serves as a collaborative space for pushing the boundaries of AI and agent-based research.

## **Mission Statement**
This repository is designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the field of multi-agent systems and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to provide a resource hub for:
- Experimenting with and testing **new agents and agent architectures**.
- Sharing **open-source tools and notebooks** to foster collaborative development.
- Curating and categorizing **the latest scientific research** on agent systems.

## **Repository Contents**

### 1. **🧠 Agent Experiments**
Explore a collection of notebooks and codebases where we experiment with various types of agents. Whether it's a reinforcement learning-based agent or a new approach to multi-agent collaboration, you'll find the latest prototypes and tests here.

### 2. **📚 Latest Research Papers**
We’ve curated a selection of the most cutting-edge scientific papers in the following categories:

- **Architecture Agents:** Papers focusing on how agent structures and frameworks are designed, including hierarchical agents, modular agents, and emergent systems.
- **Foundation Models & Large Language Models (LLMs):** A directory of papers examining how large-scale models, like GPT or BERT, serve as foundational agents or interact with multi-agent systems.
- **Graph & RAG Systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Research into how graph structures and RAG systems are being integrated into agentic systems, enabling more efficient retrieval and enhanced decision-making.
- **Agent Definitions & Theories:** A collection of philosophical and theoretical papers that define what an agent is, how they are classified, and new paradigms in agent intelligence.
- **Agent Tools & Frameworks:** Exploration of the latest tools for building, managing, and testing multi-agent systems, including libraries, simulators, and benchmarking frameworks.

Each paper is annotated with a summary, relevance, and links to both the official publication and any open-source implementations (where available).

### 3. **⚙️ Open-Source Tools**
This section hosts various open-source libraries and utilities designed for working with multi-agent systems. You’ll find frameworks for:
- Agent-based simulations
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Communication and negotiation between agents
- Graph-based agent tools
- Model-driven agent development tools
