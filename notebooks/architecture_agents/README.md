# Architecture Agents Notebooks

Welcome to the `architecture_agents` notebooks directory. This folder contains various Jupyter notebooks related to the design and implementation of agent architectures.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find notebooks focusing on different aspects of agent architectures, including hierarchical agents, modular agents, and emergent systems. The goal is to explore and test new approaches to building and organizing agents to improve their performance and capabilities.

## Contents

- **Hierarchical Agents:** Notebooks with experiments and analyses on agents organized in a hierarchical structure to achieve better coordination and decision-making.
- **Modular Agents:** Notebooks with experiments and analyses on agents composed of interchangeable modules, allowing for flexible and adaptive behavior.
- **Emergent Systems:** Notebooks exploring how complex behaviors can emerge from simple agent interactions.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the notebooks.
2. **Running Notebooks:** Each notebook has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the notebook.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the notebooks, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any notebooks.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
