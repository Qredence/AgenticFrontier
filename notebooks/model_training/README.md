# Model Training Notebooks

Welcome to the `model_training` notebooks directory. This folder contains various Jupyter notebooks related to the training of machine learning models.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find notebooks focusing on different aspects of model training, including data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools and examples to help you train effective machine learning models.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:** Notebooks with experiments and analyses on preparing and cleaning data for model training.
- **Model Selection:** Notebooks with experiments and analyses on choosing the right model for your specific task.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Notebooks exploring various methods and strategies for optimizing model hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation:** Notebooks examining different techniques for evaluating model performance and ensuring robustness.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the notebooks.
2. **Running Notebooks:** Each notebook has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the notebook.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the notebooks, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any notebooks.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
