# LLM_KG_lab Experiments

Welcome to the `LLM_KG_lab` experiments directory. This folder contains various experiments related to the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

## Overview

In this directory, you will find experiments focusing on different aspects of combining LLMs and KGs, including data integration, knowledge extraction, and reasoning. The goal is to explore and test new approaches to enhance the capabilities of LLMs using structured knowledge from KGs.

## Contents

- **Data Integration:** Experiments with integrating data from various sources into a unified knowledge graph.
- **Knowledge Extraction:** Experiments with extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text using LLMs.
- **Reasoning:** Experiments exploring how LLMs can perform reasoning tasks using knowledge graphs.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the experiments.
2. **Running Experiments:** Each experiment has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the experiment.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the experiments, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any experiments.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
