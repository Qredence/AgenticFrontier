# Graph RAG Systems Experiments

Welcome to the `graph_RAG_systems` experiments directory. This folder contains various experiments related to the integration of graph structures and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find experiments focusing on different aspects of combining graph structures and RAG systems, including data retrieval, knowledge representation, and enhanced decision-making. The goal is to explore and test new approaches to improve the efficiency and capabilities of RAG systems using graph-based methods.

## Contents

- **Data Retrieval:** Experiments with efficient data retrieval techniques using graph structures.
- **Knowledge Representation:** Experiments with representing structured knowledge in graph formats to enhance RAG systems.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Experiments exploring how graph-based methods can improve decision-making processes in RAG systems.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the experiments.
2. **Running Experiments:** Each experiment has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the experiment.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the experiments, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any experiments.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
