# Prompty Agent Experiments

Welcome to the `prompty_agent` experiments directory. This folder contains various experiments related to the development and testing of prompt-based agents.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find experiments focusing on different aspects of prompt-based agents, including prompt engineering, response generation, and context management. The goal is to explore and test new approaches to improve the performance and capabilities of prompt-based agents.

## Contents

- **Prompt Engineering:** Experiments with different techniques for designing and optimizing prompts to elicit desired responses from agents.
- **Response Generation:** Experiments with various methods for generating responses based on given prompts and contexts.
- **Context Management:** Experiments exploring how to effectively manage and utilize context information to enhance agent responses.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the experiments.
2. **Running Experiments:** Each experiment has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the experiment.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the experiments, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any experiments.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
