# Agent Theories Experiments

Welcome to the `agent_theories` experiments directory. This folder contains various experiments related to the theoretical foundations and definitions of agents.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find experiments focusing on different aspects of agent theories, including agent definitions, classifications, and new paradigms in agent intelligence. The goal is to explore and test new theoretical approaches to understanding and defining agents.

## Contents

- **Agent Definitions:** Experiments with different definitions and conceptualizations of what constitutes an agent.
- **Agent Classifications:** Experiments with various classification schemes for categorizing agents based on their characteristics and behaviors.
- **New Paradigms:** Experiments exploring new paradigms and frameworks for understanding agent intelligence and behavior.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the experiments.
2. **Running Experiments:** Each experiment has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the experiment.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the experiments, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any experiments.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
