# Architecture Agents Experiments

Welcome to the `architecture_agents` experiments directory. This folder contains various experiments related to the design and implementation of agent architectures.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find experiments focusing on different aspects of agent architectures, including hierarchical agents, modular agents, and emergent systems. The goal is to explore and test new approaches to building and organizing agents to improve their performance and capabilities.

## Contents

- **Hierarchical Agents:** Experiments with agents organized in a hierarchical structure to achieve better coordination and decision-making.
- **Modular Agents:** Experiments with agents composed of interchangeable modules, allowing for flexible and adaptive behavior.
- **Emergent Systems:** Experiments exploring how complex behaviors can emerge from simple agent interactions.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:** Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the experiments.
2. **Running Experiments:** Each experiment has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific instructions on how to run the experiment.
3. **Contributing:** If you have new ideas or improvements for the experiments, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running any experiments.
- Refer to the `setup.md` file for detailed setup instructions.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the maintainers.

Happy experimenting!
