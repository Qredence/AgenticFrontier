# Architecture Agents Papers

Welcome to the `architecture_agents` papers directory. This folder contains various research papers related to the design and implementation of agent architectures.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find papers focusing on different aspects of agent architectures, including hierarchical agents, modular agents, and emergent systems. The goal is to explore and understand new approaches to building and organizing agents to improve their performance and capabilities.

## Contents

- **Hierarchical Agents:** Papers discussing agents organized in a hierarchical structure to achieve better coordination and decision-making.
- **Modular Agents:** Papers on agents composed of interchangeable modules, allowing for flexible and adaptive behavior.
- **Emergent Systems:** Papers exploring how complex behaviors can emerge from simple agent interactions.

## Instructions

1. **Reading Papers:** Each paper has its own directory with a `README.md` file containing specific information about the paper.
2. **Contributing:** If you have new papers or improvements for the collection, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
